                <li><b><span class="point">Efficient Searching:</span></b>When searching for information online, use specific keywords and filters to narrow down your results. Utilize search operators such as quotation marks for exact phrases or the minus sign to exclude specific terms. Additionally, familiarize yourself with advanced search features offered by search engines to refine your queries further.</li>
                <li><b><span class="point">Website Navigation:</span></b>When visiting websites, pay attention to their layout and navigation menus. Look for clear and intuitive navigation links that guide you to different sections of the site. Utilize breadcrumbs or site maps to easily backtrack or explore related content. Opt for websites with responsive designs that adapt well to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across devices.</li>
                <li><b><span class="point">Assessing Credibility:</span></b>With the abundance of information available online, it's essential to critically evaluate the credibility of sources. Look for reputable websites, authoritative authors, and recent publication dates when accessing information. Be cautious of misinformation or biased sources, and cross-reference information from multiple reliable sources to verify its accuracy.</li>
                <li><b><span class="point"> Privacy Settings:</span></b>Take control of your online privacy by reviewing and adjusting privacy settings on social media platforms, web browsers, and other online services. Limit the amount of personal information you share publicly and regularly audit your privacy preferences to ensure they align with your comfort level. Consider using privacy-enhancing tools such as ad blockers, tracking blockers, and virtual private networks (VPNs) to further protect your online privacy.</li>
